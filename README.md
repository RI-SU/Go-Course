# Go Course
 All the challenge modules and the personal projects being done while going through the freecodecamp course on YouTube.


- 23/2: 
 Need to get used to currying, how anon functions work, how structs work alongside range loops. (Arrays in Go are Lists in Python as Slices in Go are Arrays in Python)

- 27/2:
  Finished with the course, 7 personal projects are available for me to finish. Learning git first to make the process of making these projects easier. Need to get used to channels mainly, rest of the course straight forward. (A send/receive to a nil channel blocks forever, send to closed channel panics, receive closed channel gives zero value, channel ranges only exit when the channel is closed)
